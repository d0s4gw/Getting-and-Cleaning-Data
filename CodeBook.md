a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

The process flow for this project is to:
(1) pull data from a remote location, 
(2) extract the compressed file, 
(3) load the extracted files into tables, 
(4) set column names,
(5) bind the training and test datasets together,
(6) extract the fields of interest,
(7) clean up the column names, 
(8) aggregate and merge the data into a tidy dataset,
(9) then finally write out the tidy data to disk.
